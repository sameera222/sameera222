### Hi! I am Sameera! 👋



- 🚀 I'm currently weaving magic with Next.js, TypeScript, and React Native!
- 📚 In the learning zone: diving into the backend universe to enhance my stack and create even more powerful applications.
- 🤝 Passionate about collaboration, I’m open to exciting projects and eager to connect with fellow developers.
- ❓ Ask me about frontend sorcery, TypeScript tricks, or anything in between—I’m here to help!
- 🎉 Fun fact: I once debugged an entire project by simply fixing a missing semicolon! Let’s code and laugh together! 😄
- 😄 Pronouns: She/Her
